# Introduction

 A Full Stack Web app I built to make life easier for competitive programmers like me. It connects to the Codeforces API and pulls in all the useful stuff—your profile, contest ratings, how many problems you've solved, and even your submission history.
It also keeps track of upcoming and past contests so you never miss a challenge. You can quickly see what contests are scheduled, how long they’ll last, and even revisit previous ones to analyze your progress or retry problems.



## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
